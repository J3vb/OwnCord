# Changelog

All notable changes to OwnCord are listed here. The repository's release
tooling (`npm run changelog`) auto-generates entries from commit messages
on each release; this file is the curated counterpart that calls out
behavioural changes operators must know about.

## v1.2.0-alpha.1 — Discord feature parity

> **Project reset note:** OwnCord has re-entered alpha. The `v1.0.0` release is
> superseded; versioning continues forward from `v1.1.0-alpha.N` so deployed
> servers and clients keep receiving updates. This release bumps the minor to
> `v1.2.0-alpha.1` to mark a large feature drop. Releases are published to this
> repository's [Releases](https://github.com/J3vb/OwnCord/releases) page,
> including a full source snapshot with every release.

This release closes most of the feature gap against basic Discord (see
[docs/plans/discord-parity.md](docs/plans/discord-parity.md) for the full
gap analysis and per-item detail). The work landed as six phases plus a
pre-release security and performance review.

### Messaging & mentions

- **Real mentions.** `@username` is now resolved server-side against unique
  usernames (address-shaped text like `mail@example` is rejected), stored per
  message, and carried on the wire — so a mention notifies, highlights the
  message, and drives a red per-channel mention badge distinct from the plain
  unread count. `@everyone` / `@here` are gated on a new `MENTION_EVERYONE`
  permission (`@here` skips offline and invisible users). `#channel` names
  render as clickable navigation chips, and the composer gains an `@`
  autocomplete.
- **Markdown rendering.** Messages render Discord-flavoured markdown — bold,
  italic, underline, strikethrough, spoilers, block quotes, headings, lists,
  masked links (`http(s)` only), and fenced code blocks with a language tag
  and lightweight syntax highlighting. Rendering is a strict DOM builder with
  no `innerHTML`. `Ctrl+B/I/U` wrap the selection in the composer.
- **Custom emoji.** Server emoji can be uploaded and managed (admin panel,
  `MANAGE_SERVER`); `:shortcode:` renders inline in messages (jumbo when a
  message is emoji-only), appears in the picker and a `:`-autocomplete, and can
  be used as a reaction.
- **Message navigation.** Search results, pinned messages, reply previews, and
  message permalinks (`owncord://message/…`, copyable from the hover bar) all
  jump to the target — fetching a window around it when it is not loaded, with
  a "Jump to Present" affordance. Reactions show a who-reacted tooltip on
  hover, video and audio attachments get inline players, and a "NEW" divider
  plus explicit Mark as Read / Mark All as Read round out read state.
- **Bulk delete.** `POST /channels/{id}/messages/purge` soft-deletes the newest
  N messages (`MANAGE_MESSAGES`), broadcasting one `chat_bulk_deleted` event.

### Roles, permissions & moderation

- **Role management.** Roles are now first-class: create, edit, delete, reorder,
  and edit permission masks and colours from the admin panel, all gated on
  `MANAGE_ROLES` and bounded by the actor's own position (you cannot touch a
  role at or above your rank, nor grant a permission bit your own role lacks).
- **The permission bits are live.** The six previously-decorative bits
  (`MANAGE_CHANNELS`, `KICK_MEMBERS`, `MUTE_MEMBERS`, `MANAGE_ROLES`,
  `MANAGE_SERVER`, `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG`) are now enforced per admin route group, so
  a Moderator role can actually moderate without being a full Administrator.
- **Per-user channel overrides.** Channel permissions resolve in Discord's
  order — base role → role override → user override — with a tri-state override
  matrix editor (role or user) in the admin panel.
- **Voice moderation.** Holders of `MUTE_MEMBERS` can server-mute, server-deafen,
  move, or disconnect a lower-ranked user; a server mute is enforced at the SFU.
- **Channel management from the desktop client.** Topics render and are editable,
  plus slowmode, an NSFW flag (with a per-session age gate), and voice
  user/video limits. Categories are now free text (any type under any name).

### Social & profiles

- **Profiles.** Avatar uploads (replacing letter-initials everywhere), display
  names (with the `@username` handle preserved for mentions), an about/bio, and
  a custom status line.
- **Presence.** Invisible is now a real status that never leaks to other users
  and survives a reconnect (the previous flash-online-on-connect bug is fixed);
  a 10-minute auto-idle that never overrides a manual status.
- **Group DMs** (2–10 participants, name, leave), **DM calls** with ringing
  (Call button + incoming-call banner over the existing DM voice path), and
  **per-channel notification mutes** (mentions still notify; other noise is
  silenced).
- **Quick wins from phase 1.** Block/unblock from the member menu, temporary
  bans, server-driven role colours, a mounted profile popup, and archived
  channels that actually hide.

### Security & performance review (pre-release)

- Channel-override endpoints now enforce grantability: a `MANAGE_CHANNELS`
  holder cannot grant itself or a user a permission bit its own role lacks,
  closing a privilege-escalation path.
- DM voice events (`voice_state`/`voice_leave`) are delivered only to the DM's
  participants instead of every user with base `READ_MESSAGES`.
- Voice moderation cannot reach a private DM call the actor is not part of.
- Mention-count bookkeeping is batched (one writer exec per 500 readers instead
  of one per reader) and resolved against a set; the markdown parser's
  bracket matching is amortized-linear; video/audio attachment blobs are
  LRU-capped and revoked, and cleared on logout.

### Phase B — Acceleration

- **Event persistence layer (Step 7).** A new `events` table backs the
  WebSocket reconnect path. When a client's `last_seq` is too old for
  the in-memory ring buffer (~1000 events), the server now falls back to
  a SQLite query before forcing a full re-sync. The hub seeds its
  monotonic sequence counter from `MAX(events.seq)` at startup so row
  seqs and wrapped-payload seqs stay aligned across restarts. Configurable
  via the new `event_persistence` block; **enabled by default** (see
  "Behavioural changes" below).
- **Tiered reconnect telemetry.** `auth_ok` now includes a `replay_source`
  field (`"none" | "buffer" | "db"`) so clients can attribute reconnection
  behaviour. The same tier label is exported as the
  `ws_reconnect_tier_total{tier}` counter.
- **OpenTelemetry skeleton (Step 8).** Public API + no-op default
  provider in `Server/telemetry/`. Chi router middleware mounted
  unconditionally. Service-layer spans on `MessageService.SendMessage`,
  `PermissionService.HasChannelPerm`,
  `ChannelService.ListVisibleChannels`, `DMService.CreateDM`,
  `VoiceService.JoinChannel`, `InviteService.CreateInvite`,
  `ModerationService.BanUser`, `BlockService.BlockUser`,
  `UserService.UpdateProfile`. The real OTel SDK is gated behind
  `-tags otel` and is currently a placeholder; completing it is
  deferred until after the beta reset.
- **Solid.js proof of concept (Step 6).** Two leaf components migrated
  (`Badge`, `ChannelListItem`), Vite + JSX configured, store→signal
  adapter landed. The remaining vanilla components remain in place;
  migration is mechanical and tracked in the local TODO.

### Phase C — Differentiation

- **Plugin runtime skeleton (Step 9).** New `Server/plugin/` package
  with manifest parser, on-disk loader, registry, and host capability
  surfaces (`commands`, `events`, `storage`, `http`, `ui`). Manifest
  format is JSON (`plugin.json`); the design's TOML format is gated
  behind the `-tags wazero` build and tracked locally.
- **Plugin admin REST surface.** Lifecycle endpoints under
  `/api/v1/admin/plugins`: list, enable, disable, uninstall, and the
  new install path that accepts a multipart zip upload, validates it
  zip-slip safe with size + symlink rejection, and atomically installs
  it. Mounted under both `AdminIPRestrict` and the
  `admin.RequireAdminAuth` session/permission middleware.
- **Plugin admin client bridge.** `pluginBridge.ts` mounts plugin UI
  tabs in sandboxed iframes with origin-validated postMessage routing.

### Security

- **SSRF defense for `http` capability.** Plugin outbound HTTP requests
  are now validated through `net/url.Parse`, suffix-matched with a dot
  boundary (so `evil-api.example.com` does not match
  `api.example.com`), and rejected for empty allowlist entries. A custom
  `Transport.DialContext` re-resolves DNS on every dial and refuses any
  resolved address in loopback / RFC1918 / RFC4193 / RFC6598 (CGN) /
  link-local / multicast / unspecified ranges. Closes the DNS-rebinding
  TOCTOU window. Response body is capped at 5 MiB.
- **Plugin manifest hardening.** `Manifest.Name` must match
  `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`. Entrypoint and UI tab asset paths are
  rejected if absolute, non-canonical, contain `..`, or contain NUL
  bytes / backslashes.
- **Plugin asset handler.** Defends against symlink escapes (rejected
  at install time via `filepath.Walk` + `Lstat`) and prefix-without-
  separator path traversal (via `filepath.Rel` check after join).
- **Plugin postMessage routing.** The host bridge looks up the trusted
  pluginId via `e.source -> contentWindow` instead of trusting the
  `pluginId` field in the message body. Spoofed messages from any
  non-iframe source are dropped.

### Behavioural changes operators must know about

- **The desktop client now actually uses the OS credential store.** The
  `keyring` crate declares no `default` feature, so the previous
  `keyring = "3"` dependency compiled its in-memory *mock* store on
  Windows, macOS and Linux alike: saves reported success and the next
  read in the same process returned nothing, and no credential was ever
  written to Credential Manager / Keychain / Secret Service. The visible
  symptom was the voice-E2EE identity keypair being regenerated, so the
  published identity key stopped matching the key that signed the voice
  announce and peers rejected it as a possible MITM. The platform
  backends are now enabled explicitly and every write is read back
  before it is reported as saved. See
  [docs/credential-storage.md](docs/credential-storage.md).
  - **Linux builds need a new system package, `libdbus-1-dev`**, for the
    Secret Service backend. CI and release workflows install it already.
  - Users on an affected machine are logged in again and re-verified by
    their peers once, then persist normally.
- **`event_persistence.enabled` defaults to `true`.** Every broadcast
  WebSocket event is written to the `events` table, retained for
  24 hours by default, and pruned by a background goroutine every hour.
  This is a new on-disk write path that did not exist before. Disable
  it by adding to `config.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  event_persistence:
    enabled: false
  ```
- **DM events are persisted under the same retention.** Operators with
  GDPR or compliance requirements should review the retention window
  and consider setting `event_persistence.enabled: false` until a
  per-channel-type opt-out lands.
- **Plugin admin endpoints require admin session auth in addition to
  the existing IP restriction.** A previous prerelease shipped with only
  the IP gate; that has been corrected.
- **The parity work adds nine database migrations (`020`–`028`) that apply
  automatically on first boot.** They add the `message_mentions`,
  `channel_user_overrides`, and emoji-supporting tables/columns, per-user
  profile fields (`display_name`, `about`, `custom_status`), channel flags
  (`nsfw`, `is_group`), and the `server_muted`/`server_deafened` voice-state
  columns; a migration also seeds the new `MENTION_EVERYONE` permission bit
  into the Owner/Admin/Moderator roles. No manual step is required, but take a
  backup before upgrading as usual. The release also introduces new WebSocket
  message types (`roles_update`, `emoji_update`, `chat_bulk_deleted`,
  `voice_mod_*`, `voice_moved`, `voice_disconnected`, `mark_read`,
  `call_ring`/`call_incoming`/`call_decline`); older clients ignore unknown
  types, and older servers omit the new fields (the client fails safe).

### Deferred work

The project is under a feature freeze until the beta reset completes.
Explicitly deferred (not abandoned unless noted): real OpenTelemetry SDK
wiring, the Postgres backend (scaffolding removed pending real demand),
the slash-command dispatcher (`docs/plans/slash-commands.md`), and the
Solid.js migration (abandoned — the experiment is being removed in favor
of the established vanilla component pattern).
